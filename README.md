<h1 >Musik Website</h1>

<p>Welcome to the "Musik" repository. This is a coded version of a previously designed interface design. This is a landing page design.</p>
<h3>Only with HTML, Tailwind CSS and JS technology.</h3>
<p>In this project, I only used HTML, TailwindCSS and JS technologies. The reason I use TailwindCSS is that it conforms to the pixel-perfect design approach and feels more free. If you haven't used Tailwind before, I would definitely recommend using it with preitter.</p>
